# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation

## Overview
This project is an implementation and exploration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an innovative approach to standardizing AI model interactions and context management.

## What is Model Context Protocol?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol developed by Anthropic that provides a standardized way to connect AI models to various data sources and systems. It acts as a universal connector, enabling more flexible and powerful AI integrations.

## Key Features of MCP
- **Standardized Context Provision**: Create a consistent interface for providing context to AI models
- **Flexible Data Integration**: Connect AI models to diverse data sources and tools
- **Enhanced Model Capabilities**: Improve AI model performance through structured context management
- **Interoperability**: Enable seamless interactions across different systems and environments

## Project Goals
- Implement MCP-compliant context management
- Develop robust methods for contextual AI interactions
- Create a flexible framework for model context exploration
