# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## Introduction

### What is the Model Context Protocol?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an innovative open protocol developed by Anthropic that provides a standardized mechanism for connecting AI models to various data sources, systems, and computational environments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Standardized Context Provision
- Create a universal interface for providing contextual information to AI models
- Ensure consistent and structured approach to model context management

### 2. Flexible Data Integration
- Enable seamless connections between AI models and diverse data sources
- Support multiple types of context inputs (text, structured data, metadata)

### 3. Enhanced Model Capabilities
- Improve AI model performance through structured and comprehensive context
- Allow models to dynamically adapt to different contextual environments

### 4. Interoperability
- Create a protocol that works across different AI models, tools, and platforms
- Reduce friction in AI system integrations

## Key Technical Components

### Context Negotiation
- Standardized method for models to request and receive contextual information
- Flexible negotiation protocols for different types of context

### Context Types
1. **Structural Context**
   - Model architecture details
   - Training environment information
   - Computational resource specifications

2. **Operational Context**
   - Current task parameters
   - Performance metrics
   - Historical interaction data

3. **Environmental Context**
   - System constraints
   - Security parameters
   - Computational limitations

### Protocol Mechanisms
- Context request and response standardization
